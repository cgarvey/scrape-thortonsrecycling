Sample Data
===========
The input file, `saved_html_1.html` was saved from Google Chrome (using the "Webpage, HTML Only" setting).

The output file was generated by running the script (from within its directory, the parent directory of this) with the arguments `./parse.pl sample_data/saved_html_1.html sample_data/output.tab`.
